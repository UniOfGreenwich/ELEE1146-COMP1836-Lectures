## Teaching and Learning Activities

<div style="font-size:28px">

This module will be taught based on a problem-solving approach. [You] will be given specific problems to solve with the underpinning material supplied by lectures and tutorials.

At the end of this module, [you] will be able to undertake an engineering challenge such as designing and developing a mobile app. The app will be developed using the basic principles of mobile development technology and incorporating various additional features like an animated user interface, playing music, and sound effects.

Learning and teaching will be by a combination of:
- Lectures/tutorials/laboratory sessions (face-to-face, video, or computer-mediated)
- Individual or group-based teaching tutorial/project
- Self-study-supported structured learning materials
